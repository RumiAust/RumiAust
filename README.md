- 👋 Hi, I’m Golam Muktadir,Software Engineer, with  master’s in Medical Engineering  who loves technologies and problem-solving.
- I like interacting with professionals and utilizing my knowledge as well as communications skills. Always ready to learn new technologies and set benchmark for continuous improvement.
- Academically, I have a bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering and worked as a Full Stack Software Engineer (OOP) 
around 2.5 years before I started my master’s degree in medical health data Analytics from FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg. My masters s
studies focus on medical imaging, medical software and applications, human computer interaction in UI and research in the field of

 which helped me to increase my knowledgebase. I am open to working on any software projects and ready to learn, implement, succeed, and complete the work with my team.
